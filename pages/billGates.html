              William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American
              business magnate, software developer, and philanthropist. He is
              best known as the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation.[2][3]
              During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of
              chairman, chief executive officer (CEO), president and chief
              software architect, while also being the largest individual
              shareholder until May 2014. He is one of the best-known
              entrepreneurs and pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the
              1970s and 1980s.

        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>
          Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955.[3] He is
          the son of William H. Gates Sr.[c] (1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell Gates
          (1929–1994).[21] His ancestry includes English, German, and
          Irish/Scots-Irish.[22] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his
          mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate
          BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather
          was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older
          sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the
          fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or
          "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.[23][24]
          The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was
          damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[25]
        </p>
        <p>
          Early in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to
          pursue a law career.[26] When he was young, his family regularly
          attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a
          Protestant Reformed denomination.[27][28][29] Gates was small for his
          age and was bullied as a child.[24] The family encouraged competition;
          one visitor reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or
          pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for
          winning and there was always a penalty for losing".[30]
        </p>
        <p>
          At 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school,[31][32] where
          he wrote his first software program.[33] When he was in the eighth
          grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside
          School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a
          block of computer time on a General Electric (GE) computer for the
          students.[34] Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in
          BASIC, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He
          wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of
          tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer.
          Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute
          software code perfectly.[35] After the Mothers Club donation was
          exhausted, Gates and other students sought time on systems including
          DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems was a PDP-10 belonging to
          Computer Center Corporation (CCC) which banned for the summer Gates,
          Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Gates's best friend and first business
          partner Kent Evans, after it caught them exploiting bugs in the
          operating system to obtain free computer time.[36][24]
        </p>
        <p>
          The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make
          money.[24] At the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in CCC's
          software in exchange for extra computer time. Rather than use the
          system remotely via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied
          source code for various programs that ran on the system, including
          Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. The arrangement with CCC
          continued until 1970 when the company went out of business.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen called Traf-O-Data to make
          traffic counters based on the Intel 8008 processor.[37] In 1972, he
          served as a congressional page in the House of
          Representatives.[38][39] He was a National Merit Scholar when he
          graduated from Lakeside School in 1973.[40] He scored 1590 out of 1600
          on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) and enrolled at Harvard College
          in the autumn of 1973.[41][42] He chose a pre-law major but took
          mathematics and graduate level computer science courses.[43] While at
          Harvard, he met fellow student Steve Ballmer. Gates left Harvard after
          two years while Ballmer stayed and graduated magna cum laude. Years
          later, Ballmer succeeded Gates as Microsoft's CEO and maintained that
          position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.[44][45]
        </p>
        <p>
          Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen and joined him at Honeywell
          during the summer of 1974.[49] In 1975, the MITS Altair 8800 was
          released based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw the
          opportunity to start their own computer software company.[50] Gates
          dropped out of Harvard that same year. His parents were supportive of
          him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company.[51] He
          explained his decision to leave Harvard: "if things hadn't worked out,
          I could always go back to school. I was officially on leave."[52]

        <p>
          Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which
          demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation
          and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were
          working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[53] In reality, Gates
          and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they
          merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts
          agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few
          weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer,
          and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's
          offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a
          deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS
          hired Allen,[54] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to
          work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership
          "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and
          their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and
          Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[54] They
          dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade
          name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on
          November 26, 1976.[54] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his
          studies.
        </p>

          Microsoft's Altair BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but
          Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being
          widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, he wrote an Open
          Letter to Hobbyists in the MITS newsletter in which he asserted that
          more than 90% of the users of Microsoft Altair BASIC had not paid
          Microsoft for it and the Altair "hobby market" was in danger of
          eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce,
          distribute, and maintain high-quality software.[55] This letter was
          unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his
          belief that software developers should be able to demand payment.
          Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to
          develop programming language software for various systems.[54] The
          company moved from Albuquerque to Bellevue, Washington on January 1,
          1979.[53]
        </p>
        <p>
          IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial
          enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning
          software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[57] IBM first
          proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. IBM's
          representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system,
          and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the
          widely used CP/M operating system.[58] IBM's discussions with Digital
          Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing
          agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing
          difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and asked if
          Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks later, Gates
          and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system similar to CP/M,
          that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for
          hardware similar to the PC.[59] Microsoft made a deal with SCP to be
          the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the full owner.
          Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system for the
          PC[60] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of
          $50,000.[61]
        </p>
        <p>
          The contract itself only earned Microsoft a relatively small fee. It
          was the prestige brought to Microsoft by IBM's adoption of their
          operating system that would be the origin of Microsoft's
          transformation from a small business to the leading software company
          in the world. Gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the
          operating system to IBM because he believed that other personal
          computer makers would clone IBM's PC hardware.[61] They did, making
          the IBM-compatible PC, running DOS, a de facto standard. The sales of
          MS-DOS (the version of DOS sold to customers other than IBM) made
          Microsoft a major player in the industry.[62] The press quickly
          identified Microsoft as being very influential on the IBM PC. PC
          Magazine asked if Gates was "the man behind the machine?".[57]
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on
          November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company struck
          a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called OS/2.
          Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of
          the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative
          differences.[65]

          Gates had primary responsibility for Microsoft's product strategy from
          the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. He gained a reputation for
          being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981
          that "Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not
          returning phone calls."[66] An Atari executive recalled that he showed
          Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a
          month later, Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game
          until he solved it. That is a competitor".[67]

          According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's
          highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by
          US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of
          Gates's assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through
          which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons
          Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[81] On February 4, 2014, Gates
          stepped down as chairman of Microsoft to become "technology advisor"
          alongside CEO Satya Nadella.[11][82]
        </p>
        <p>
          Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial
          interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling
          Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on
          climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and
          people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a
          question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the
          future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll
          happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the
          scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a
          pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified
          innovation as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that
          "America's way better today than it's ever been."[83]
        </p>
        <p>
          Sn an interview that was held at the TED conference in March 2015,
          with Baidu's CEO, Robin Li, Gates said he would "highly recommend"
          Nick Bostrom's recent work, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers,
          Strategies.[88] During the conference, Gates warned that the world was
          not prepared for the next pandemic, a situation that would come to
          pass in late 2019 when the COVID-19 pandemic began.[89] In March 2018,
          Gates met at his home in Seattle with Mohammed bin Salman, the
          reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia to discuss
          investment opportunities for Saudi Vision 2030.[90][91] In June 2019,
          Gates admitted that losing the mobile operating system race to Android
          was his biggest mistake. He stated that it was within their skill set
          of being the dominant player, but partially blames the antitrust
          litigation during the time.[92] That same year, Gates became an
          Advisory Board Member of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.[93]
        </p>
        <p>
          On March 13, 2020, Microsoft announced Gates would be leaving his
          board positions at Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft to dedicate his
          efforts in philanthropic endeavors such as climate change, global
          health and development, and education.[94]
