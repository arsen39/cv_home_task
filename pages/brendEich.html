        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>
          Eich grew up in Pittsburgh; Gaithersburg, Maryland; and Palo Alto,[4]
          and he attended Ellwood P. Cubberley High School, graduating in the
          class of 1979. He received his bachelor's degree in mathematics and
          computer science at Santa Clara University,[4] and he received his
          master's degree in 1985 from the University of Illinois at
          Urbana-Champaign.[4]

          He began his career at Silicon Graphics, working for seven years on
          operating system and network code.[7] He then worked for three years
          at MicroUnity Systems Engineering writing microkernel and DSP code,
          and doing the first MIPS R4000 port of GCC.[7][failed verification]

          Eich started work at Netscape Communications Corporation in April
          1995. Eich originally joined intending to put Scheme "in the
          browser",[8] but his Netscape superiors insisted that the language's
          syntax resemble that of Java. As a result, Eich devised a language
          that had much of the functionality of Scheme, the object-orientation
          of Self, and the syntax of Java. He completed the first version in ten
          days in order to accommodate the Navigator 2.0 Beta release
          schedule,[8][9] and was called Mocha, but renamed LiveScript in
          September 1995 and finally named JavaScript in December.[10] Eich
          continued to oversee the development of SpiderMonkey, the specific
          implementation of JavaScript in Navigator.[11]

        <p>
          In early 1998, Eich co-founded the free and open source software
          project Mozilla with Jamie Zawinski and others, creating the
          mozilla.org website, which was meant to manage open-source
          contributions to the Netscape source code. He served as Mozilla's
          chief architect.[12] AOL bought Netscape in 1999. After AOL shut down
          the Netscape browser unit in July 2003, Eich helped spin out the
          Mozilla Foundation.[13]

          In August 2005, after serving as a lead technologist and as a member
          of the board of directors of the Mozilla Foundation, Eich became chief
          technical officer (CTO) of the newly founded Mozilla Corporation,
          meant to be the Mozilla Foundation's for-profit arm.[13] Eich
          continued to "own" the Mozilla SpiderMonkey module, its JavaScript
          engine until he passed on the ownership of it in 2011.[11]

          On March 24, 2014, Mozilla made the decision to appoint Eich as CEO of
          Mozilla Corporation.[14][15][16] The appointment triggered widespread
          criticism due to Eich's past political donations[14][17][18][19] –
          specifically, a 2008 donation of $1,000 to California Proposition 8,
          which called for the banning of same-sex marriage in California,[1]
          and donations in the amount of $2,100 to Proposition 8 supporter Tom
          McClintock between 2008 and 2010.[20] The Wall Street Journal
          initially reported that, in protest against his coming appointment,
          half of Mozilla's board (Gary Kovacs, John Lilly, and Ellen Siminoff)
          stepped down,[21][22][23][24] leaving Mitchell Baker, Reid Hoffman,
          and Katharina Borchert.[25] CNET later reported that of the three
          board members who had left, only Lilly left due to Eich's
          appointment.[25] Lilly told The New York Times, "I left rather than
          appoint him", and declined to elaborate further.[26]

          On March 26, 2014, Eich expressed "sorrow for causing pain" and
          pledged to "work with LGBT communities and allies" at Mozilla.[21][20]
          Some of the activists created an online campaign against Eich, with
          online dating site OkCupid automatically displaying a message to
          Firefox users with information about Eich's donation, and suggesting
          that users switch to a different browser (although giving them a link
          to continue with Firefox).[27][28][29] CREDO Mobile collected more
          than 50,000 signatures demanding that Eich resign.[16][30]
        </p>
        <p>
          After 11 days as CEO, Eich resigned on April 3, 2014, and left Mozilla
          over his opposition to same-sex marriage.[31][2][32] In his personal
          blog, he posted, "under the present circumstances, I cannot be an
          effective leader".[3][33] Mozilla made a press release saying that
          board members tried to get Eich to stay in the company in a different
          role, but that he had chosen to sever ties for the time being.[34]
