            <p>
              Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ˈzʌkərbɜːrɡ/; born May 14, 1984) is an
              American media magnate, internet entrepreneur, and philanthropist.
              He is known for co-founding Facebook, Inc. and serves as its
              chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling
              shareholder.[3][4] He also is a co-founder of the solar sail
              spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot and serves as
              one of its board members.[5] Born in White Plains, New York,
              Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, where he launched the
              Facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on
              February 4, 2004, with college roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew
              McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[6] Originally
              launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and
              eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012.
              Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority
              shares. In 2007, at age 23, he became the world's youngest
              self-made billionaire. As of November 2020, Zuckerberg's net worth
              is $96.7 billion,[7] making him the 4th-richest person in the
              world.[8] He is the only person under 40-years-old in Forbes' list
              of the 20 richest people.[9] Since 2010, Time magazine has named
              Zuckerberg among the 100 most influential people in the world as a
              part of its Person of the Year award.[10][11][12] In December
              2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's
              Most Powerful People.[13]

        <h3>Early life</h3>
        <p>
          Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York.[14]
          His parents are Karen (née Kempner), a psychiatrist, and Edward
          Zuckerberg, a dentist.[15] He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and
          Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester
          County village about 21 miles (34 km) north of Midtown Manhattan.[16]
          Zuckerberg was raised in a Reform Jewish household,[17][18] and his
          ancestors hailed from Germany, Austria and Poland.[19] He had a Star
          Wars-themed bar mitzvah when he turned 13.[17][20]
        </p>
        <p>
          At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. After two
          years, he transferred to the private school Phillips Exeter Academy,
          where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical
          studies. In his youth, he also attended the Johns Hopkins Center for
          Talented Youth summer camp. On his college application, Zuckerberg
          stated that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient
          Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.[21][22][23]

        <h3>College years</h3>
        <p>
          The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at
          Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a "reputation as a
          programming prodigy." He studied psychology and computer science and
          belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House.[11][16][28] In his
          sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which
          allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices
          of other students and also to help them form study groups. A short
          time later, he created a different program he initially called
          Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a
          choice of photos. According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at
          the time, "he built the site for fun."
        </p>
        <p>
          The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college
          shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's
          network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet.
          In addition, many students complained that their photos were being
          used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the
          student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely
          improper."[29]
        </p>
        <p>
          The following semester, in January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code
          for a new website.[30] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched
          "Thefacebook," originally located at thefacebook.com.[31]
        </p>
        <p>
          Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron
          Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg
          of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them
          build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, while he was
          instead using their ideas to build a competing product.[32] The three
          complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an
          investigation in response.[citation needed]
        </p>
        <p>
          Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform,
          the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a
          settlement.[33] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook
          shares.[34]
        </p>
        <p>
          On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement Day, Zuckerberg,
          after giving a commencement speech,[37] received an honorary degree
          from Harvard.[38][39]

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>
          On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard
          dormitory room.[41][42] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have
          come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which
          Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory,
          "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The
          Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of the
          student social experience at many private schools. With them, students
          were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends,
          and their telephone numbers.[41]
        </p>
        <p>
          Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard
          thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools,
          enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with
          Columbia University, New York University, Stanford, Dartmouth,
          Cornell, University of Pennsylvania, Brown, and Yale.[43] Samyr Laine,
          a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer Olympics, shared
          a room with Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. "Mark was clearly
          on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth
          user.[44]
        </p>
        <p>
          Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and some friends moved to Palo Alto, California
          in Silicon Valley where they leased a small house that served as an
          office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in
          the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to
          Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually
          decided to remain in California.[45][46] They had already turned down
          offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in
          2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the
          amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is
          that we create an open information flow for people. Having media
          corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to
          me."[42]
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the
          Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly thinks of himself
          as a hacker". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make
          them better".[50][51] Facebook instituted "hackathons" held every six
          to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of
          and complete a project.[50] The company provided music, food, and beer
          at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including
          Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[51] "The idea is that you can build
          something really good in a night", Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's
          part of the personality of Facebook now ... It's definitely very core
          to my personality."[50]

          Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the
          Top 100 "most influential people of the Information Age".[52]
          Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[53]
          In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual
          survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[54]
